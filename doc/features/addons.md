# Addons
The full name of Addons is "Scratch Addons", It is a browser extension that provides new features and themes for the Scratch website and project editor.

## Usage
We have modified the original Scratch Addons so that others can work normally on ClipCC. You can [download](https://github.com/Clipteam/addons/releases) our modified browser extension to use it.

## Tips
1. This fork is a editor-only extension, all community addons are unavailable.
2. It's currently not available on desktop.
3. We cannot guarantee that any ClipCC version can use the extension perfectly, please test it yourself.
