# Custom Reporter
This feature can better complete some calculations in the project.

## Usage
"Functions" in Category Menu -> "Make a Function" -> "Check 'return' option"

## Tips
1. Is undefined for short-circuiting operations of logical operations and the order in which parameters are calculated. This issue may be fixed later, but you should still make sure that your current project does not have behavior that depends on these features.
2. You cannot edit the type of your custom blocks due to restriction in Blockly.
3. To avoid confusing the parameters with the custom reporter, we adjusted the original colors.
