# Introduction

ClipCC is a scratch mod that supports custom reporters, new extension system and more features.

ClipCC started as a successor to another scratch mod called "G-Editor" in 2017, focusing on add features. With the help of many other contributors, we have maintained this project to this day.

# Why created ClipCC?

Scratch does a good enough job at being a good programming starter tool for kids. But because of this, the Scratch Team had to prioritize whether the features in Scratch were easy enough to be understood by younger children. This has led to many limitations.

However, this is a fact that is not satisfying enough for me. I wanted to add more useful features to Scratch, while retaining Scratch's strength in playing with creativity. Thus, ClipCC was born. If you know Snap!, you can roughly understand ClipCC as a Scratch-based Snap! Our aim is to introduce some higher-order programming contents and features.

# About compatibility

You can't have it both ways, and we've chosen to add features while giving up some compatibility. We have our own community system and will be developing a packager in the future to alleviate this issue, while we provide limited compatibility support. If you can't live with that, maybe you can try [Turbowarp](https://turbowarp.org).
